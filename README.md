# HSLU.Raytracing
Module raytracing from the ground up

This project demonstrates the progressive development of a raytracing engine, from basic pixel rendering to complex 3D scenes with lighting and shadows.

## Development Stages

### Stage 1: Basic Pixel Rendering

A basic implementation of raytracing with a single green sphere, demonstrating fundamental ray-sphere intersection.

### Stage 3: Solid Primitives with Shading

Adding simple shading to create a more three-dimensional appearance for a single sphere.

### Stage 4: Color Compositing

Implementation of color blending and transparency with overlapping shapes to demonstrate the RGB color model.

### Stage 5: Multiple Spherical Objects

Scaling up to render multiple spherical objects with various colors and sizes.

### Stage 6: Complex Arrangements

Further complexity with many spheres in a structured arrangement, demonstrating depth and occlusion handling.

### Stage 7: Surface Detail and Material Properties

Adding material properties to objects with a blue sphere featuring a teal highlight, showing reflection or material transition.

### Stage 8: Composite Objects

Creating composite objects by arranging primitives to form more complex structures, like this simple face.

### Stage 9: Advanced Scene with Multiple Primitives and Shadows
